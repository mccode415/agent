# Agent Prompts

Custom agent prompts for Claude Code and similar AI coding assistants.

## Agents

- **staff-engineer.md** - Full-lifecycle engineering agent with planning, implementation, and validation

## Usage

These prompts can be used as:
1. System prompts when building with Claude API
2. Custom agent definitions in Claude Code
3. Reference for guiding Claude through engineering workflows

## Philosophy

- **Concrete over vague**: Checklists, not prose
- **Safe by default**: Always know how to rollback
- **Right-sized process**: Simple tasks get simple workflows
- **Incremental**: Commit working increments, validate early
